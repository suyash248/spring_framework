Merging behavior applies similarly to the <list/>, <map/>, and <set/> collection types. In the specific case of the <list/> element, the semantics 
associated with the List collection type, that is, the notion of an ordered collection of values, is maintained; the parent's values precede all of the 
child list's values. In the case of the Map, Set, and Properties collection types, no ordering exists. Hence no ordering semantics are in effect for the 
collection types that underlie the associated Map, Set, and Properties implementation types that the container uses internally.



LIMITATION OF MERGING

You cannot merge different collection types (such as a Map and a List), and if you do attempt to do so an appropriate Exception is thrown. The merge 
attribute must be specified on the lower, inherited, child definition; specifying the merge attribute on a parent collection definition is redundant and 
will not result in the desired merging. The merging feature is available only in Spring 2.0 and later.
