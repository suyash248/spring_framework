Model and Map can be used to return data in simple JSON format.
ModelAndView is used to return the model(i.e. model map) and view to front end.
String can be used fto return the view name.

The following return types are supported for handler methods:

A ModelAndView object, with the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods.

A Model object, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator and the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods.

A Map object for exposing a model, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator and the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods.

A View object, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a Model argument (see above).

A String value that is interpreted as the logical view name, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a Model argument (see above).

void if the method handles the response itself (by writing the response content directly, declaring an argument of type ServletResponse / HttpServletResponse for that purpose) or if the view name is supposed to be implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator (not declaring a response argument in the handler method signature).

If the method is annotated with @ResponseBody, the return type is written to the response HTTP body. The return value will be converted to the declared method argument type using HttpMessageConverters.

A HttpEntity<?> or ResponseEntity<?> object to provide access to the Servlet reponse HTTP headers and contents. The entity body will be converted to the response stream using HttpMessageConverters. See Section 15.3.2.7, “Using HttpEntity<?>”.

Any other return type is considered to be a single model attribute to be exposed to the view, using the attribute name specified through @ModelAttribute at the method level (or the default attribute name based on the return type class name). The model is implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods.
